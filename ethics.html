            <h2>Ethical Issues with Cobalt Mining</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
              Li-on Batteries are not only found in EVs but also in most
              electronic devices, including the phone or laptop you may be using
              to read this very blog. As mentioned previously, cobalt is a key
              raw material in Li-on battery manufacturing.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              However, the mass volume of EV batteries that would need to be
              manufactured to meet the growing demands require vastly more
              cobalt per unit than any other consumer electronic device out
              there. According to Bloomberg, the EU requires 64,000 tons of
              cobalt worth around $3.2 billion by 2030 to foster a transition to
              EVs.

            <p class="paragraph">
              Currently, 70% of the worldâ€™s cobalt comes from the Democratic
              Republic of Congo.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Numerous reports and surveys have shown that the working
              conditions in at least one third of these mines are dangerous. In
              one incident, a mine collapsed and killed 63 people, burying them
              alive instantly. Deaths and injury are a constant in the Congolese
              cobalt mines.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Furthermore, the workers are criminally underpaid, earning 1 or 2
              US dollars a day.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Many of these workers are also children, employed due to lax child
              labour laws. While cobalt suppliers such as Glencore, who provide
              Tesla with their supply of cobalt, insist that their cobalt is
              ethically source, wage issues are still of concern, and there is a
              lack of oversight in the industry. Furthermore, cobalt sourced
              from unregulated freelancers are often mixed in and processed,
              being distributed to major EV manufacturers and everyday consumer
              electronics manufacturers, meaning it is almost impossible to know
              whether you own a device which contains the fruits of child
              exploitation or not.
            </p>

              />
              <p class="image-caption">Image source: CBC</p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
              There are solutions to this problem however, including better
              regulation and stricter policies for ethically sourced cobalt from
              those higher up the product pipeline. Additionally, lawsuits are
              being levied against major corporations such as Microsoft, Apple,
              Tesla, and Alphabet on behalf of the families of the Congolese
              workers who have lost their lives or been injured due to these
              cobalt mines. Finally, competition from a new store of cobalt in
              Australia can allow EV companies to source their cobalt more
              ethically while dropping prices to attract consumers.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              At the end of the day however, this is a problem that must be
              addressed by the EV industry, and the tech industry as a whole, as
              we work on reducing carbon emissions. The moral obligation to
              uphold human rights must outweigh profits in every case, and
              fixing this problem is paramount, especially in the name of
              ensuring a better world for us all to inhabit.
