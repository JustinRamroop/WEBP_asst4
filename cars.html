            <h2>Before we talk about the issues…</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              It is important to address that it is settled science that EVs are
              the way forward for cleaner and greener transportation. While the
              manufacturing of an EV provides higher greenhouse emissions than
              the manufacturing of a tradition motor vehicle, according to MIT,
              this is offset by the energy efficiency that comes with the EV’s
              operation over time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              It is often argued by proponents of the fossil fuel industry that,
              due to the electrical grids of many countries running
              overwhelmingly on fossil fuels, that EVs contribute to climate
              change as much as traditional ICE cars too. This, according to
              Sergey Paltsev of MIT’s Energy Initiative, is untrue.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              According to Paltsev, the net carbon output of the average EV in
              the US is around 200 grams of CO2 per mile. According to the EPA,
              the average carbon output of a traditional car is around 411 grams
              of CO2 per mile. This 50% reduction is only expected to increase
              as EVs get more efficient and the energy grid is cleaned up,
              possibly even reaching 50 grams of CO2 per mile in 2050.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              From a pure market perspective, the EV industry is not liable to
              be slowing down any time soon. As shown in the chart below, global
              EV sales have grown by more than 6200%.

            <p class="paragraph">
              This sustained growth is not ignorable by investors, and many
              companies which rely on transportation for their business such as
              Uber and Lyft have largely begun to make their fleets electric.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The hype behind electric vehicles extends to the general public,
              who often find the advances in these technologies impressive. Even
              people who are, for one reason or the other, skeptical of climate
              research, are often impressed by the newest EVs on the market due
              to their raw power and unique designs. Thus EVs can be seen as a
              marketing and awareness tool to unify political aisles over the
              very real and prescient problem of climate change.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              However, there is one major problematic component with the current
              design of EVs, which must be dealt with as soon as possible,
              before widespread adoption of EVs makes it even more difficult to
              solve.
