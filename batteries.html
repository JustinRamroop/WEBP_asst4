            <h2>EV Batteries</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Electric Vehicles run on lithium-ion batteries. This involves the
              creation of dedicated large-scale factories known as
              gigafactories, producing batteries by the thousands, and
              themselves contributing a large amount to global emissions,
              essentially taking the place of the emissions of a traditional car
              over its lifetime and transferring it to the beginning of the
              process.

            <p class="paragraph">
              According to environmental science researcher Florian Knobloch,
              battery production is the primary driver behind the increase in
              emissions in the manufacture of EVs.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              These gigafactories are also often still powered by fossil fuels
              through direct industrial lines regardless of the sources of their
              host nation’s power grid due to the large amount of energy
              required, though strides are being taken to reduce the carbon
              footprint of these factories.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Raw materials such as cobalt and lithium, which are critical to
              the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, are also energy
              intensive to mine and transport, further increasing the carbon
              footprint of EV batteries.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              EVs are not a magical solution to the climate crisis, as simply
              replacing all 1.2 billion gas-powered cars with EVs will not
              reduce emissions due to the volume of batteries that will need to
              be produced, regardless of how clean the energy grid is.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              According to Knobloch, society will have to change to fully reap
              the benefits that the decarbonisation of the energy grid and of
              transport will bring. Electric Vehicles are just one step in that
              direction. Embracing public transport as well as remote work and
              learning should be a key factor in reducing the harmful effects of
              climate change.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              There is, however, still one major factor in the manufacture of
              EVs that is of major concern, especially to human rights
              activists, and without a mitigation strategy, the opportunity EVs
              give to increase the quality of life for global citizens may come
              at the cost of many human lives…
