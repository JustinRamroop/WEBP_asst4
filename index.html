            <p class="paragraph">
              Over the course of the 2010s, electric vehicles (EVs) have become
              a massive industry, increasingly becoming visible on the worldâ€™s
              motorways.

            <p class="paragraph">
              During the 2010s and early 2020s, the EV industry went from
              selling tens of thousands of units per year to ballooning into a
              300 billion dollar industry, with expected growth to shatter the
              trillion dollar ceiling by 2028, according to projections from
              Fortune Business Insights.

              Of note is the carbon footprint of EVs compared to the current
              status quo of vehicles which run on internal combustion engines
              (ICEs). Experts broadly agree that EVs are better for the
              environment than ICEs, which contribute to emissions at a far
              greater rate.

              From flimsy promises and buzzy stocks to widespread adoption by
              the biggest car manufacturers, with broad support from governments
              around the world, electric vehicles are here to stay. Consumers
              are increasingly shopping for greener cars and the dropping cost
              of EVs are no doubt going to entice consumers.

              However, there is a dark side which is not discussed often in the
              public but presents a massive environmental and moral quandary for
              manufacturers of EVs to solve. EVs are not going away, nor should
              they, as they have been proven to be the way forward for green
              vehicular transportation.
